# ProBF
Implementation of ProBF: Learning Probabilistic Safety Certificates with Barrier Functions presented at NeurIPS 2021 SafeRL workshop. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12210)

This code compares the our ProBF-GP framework with the prior art learned Control Barrier Functions which uses a neural network (LCBF-NN) [2]. We build upon the code in [1]. We add a controller that uses the mean and variance of the predictions to solve the ProBF-convex program.
