# ProBF
Implementation of ProBF: Learning Probabilistic Safety Certificates with Barrier Functions presented at NeurIPS 2021 SafeRL workshop. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12210)

This code compares the our ProBF-GP framework with the prior art learned Control Barrier Functions which uses a neural network (LCBF-NN) [2]. We build upon the code in [1]. We added a controller that uses the mean and variance of the predictions to solve the ProBF-convex program. This controller can be found in "core/controllers/filter_controller_var.py".

## LCBF-NN
### Dependencies
1.  cudatoolkit=10.1
2.  python>=3.8.5
3.  tensorflow=2.3.0
4.  keras=2.2.4

### Instructions for running the experiment
For running the LCBF, we use the tensorflow backbone provided by the authors of [2]. The environment used for running the code is listed in "tf_env.yml".
1.  segway_nn.py - Train the LCBF-NN with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the segway framework.
2.  quadrotor_nn.py - Train the LCBF-NN with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the quadrotor framework. 

## ProBF-GP ( Our approach )
### Dependencies
1.  cvxpy=1.1.10
2.  gpytorch=1.3.1
3.  cudatoolkit=10.1
4.  python>=3.8.5
5.  pytorch=1.7.1

### Instructions for running the experiment
For running the Pro-BF, we use gpytorch for GP training. The environment used for running the code is listed in "pytorch_env.yml".
1.  segway_gp.py - Train the ProBF-GP with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the segway framework.
2.  quadrotor_gp.py - Train the ProBF-GP with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the quadrotor framework.
