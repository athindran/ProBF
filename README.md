# ProBF
Implementation of Probabilistic Barrier Certificates submitted to NeuRIPS 2021 safeRL workshop.

This code compares the ProBF-GP framework with the prior art LCBF which uses a neural network. We build upon the code in [1].

## LCBF-NN
### Dependencies
1.  cudatoolkit=10.1
2.  python=3.8.5
3.  tensorflow=2.3.0
4.  keras==2.2.4

### Instructions for running the experiment
For running the LCBF, we use the tensorflow backbone provided by the authors of [2]. The environment used for running the code is listed in "tf_env.yml".
1.  segway_nn.py - Train the LCBF-NN with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the segway framework.
2.  quadrotor_nn.py - Train the LCBF-NN with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the quadrotor framework. 

## ProBF-GP ( Our approach )
### Dependencies
1.  cvxpy=1.1.10
2.  gpytorch=1.3.1
3.  cudatoolkit=10.1
4.  python=3.9.2
5.  pytorch=1.7.1

### Instructions for running the experiment
For running the Pro-BF, we use gpytorch for GP training. The environment used for running the code is listed in "pytogpu.yml".
1.  segway_gp.py - Train the ProBF-GP with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the segway framework.
2.  quadrotor_gp.py - Train the ProBF-GP with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the quadrotor framework.
