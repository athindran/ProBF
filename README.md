# ProBF
Implementation of Probabilistic Barrier Certificates submitted to NeuRIPS 2021 safeRL workshop.

This code compares the ProBF-GP framework with the prior art LCBF which uses a neural network. We build upon the code in [1].

### LCBF-NN
For running the LCBF, we use the tensorflow backbone provided by the authors of [2]. The environment used for running the code is listed in "tf_env.yml".
1.  segway_nn.py - Train the LCBF-NN with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the segway framework.
2.  quadrotor_nn.py - Train the LCBF-NN with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the quadrotor framework. 

### ProBF-GP ( Our approach )
For running the Pro-BF, we use gpytorch for GP training. The environment used for running the code is listed in "pytogpu.yml".
1.  segway_gp.py - Train the ProBF-GP with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the segway framework.
2.  quadrotor_gp.py - Train the ProBF-GP with 10 different seeds and test each time on 10 seeds for the quadrotor framework.
